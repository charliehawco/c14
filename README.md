#Ok, so basically this program should take the measurements of each character in the alphabet plus capitals, then create a list of

#all possible combinations of letters and check to see if they fit the width of a redacted area of text

#obviously, if an accepted combination (because it's the correct size) contains spaces, then obviously it's not going to come up

#with a word in the dictionary, so it then adds those strings to a separate list then splits them by spaces

#then runs it through the dictionary

#ps I'd prefer it if you kept this to yourself for now, wanting to write a paper on it

#:)
